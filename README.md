# ðŸ“‹Project 4-Feed Reader Testing

![Alt text](image/overview.png?raw=true)

This is my forth project from Udacity Front End Nano Degree. It is an assessment after learning Javascript testing with Gulp and Jasmine. In this project, the starter pack comes with a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. It already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and a demo for the first test suite. My task is to complete test suite according to the comments requirements.

## ðŸ¤”Why this Project?

Testing is an important part of the development process and many organizations practice a standard of development known as "test-driven development." This is when developers write tests first, before they ever start developing their application. All the tests initially fail and then they start writing application code to make these tests pass.

Writing effective tests requires analyzing multiple aspects of an application including the HTML, CSS and JavaScript - an extremely important skill when changing teams or joining a new company.

Good tests give you the ability to quickly analyze whether new code breaks an existing feature within your codebase, without having to manually test all of the functionality.

Whether you work in an organization that uses test-driven development or in an organization that uses tests to make sure future feature development doesn't break existing features, it's an important skill to have.

## ðŸ¤“What I have learn

I have learnt how to use Jasmine to write a number of tests against a pre-existing application. They have been testing the underlying business logic of the application as well as the event handling and DOM manipulation.

## ðŸ’¡ How to run the application

- Open the html file or use the live server from Text Editor
- All the tests are written in the feedreader.js file under the jamine file
- All the Javascript that we tested against are in the app.js file under js file

## âœ… Challenge Checklist

**Required Elements**

- Project Rubric [Review](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/18/view)

The page at minimum includes all of the following:

- [x] No test should be dependent on the results of another
- [x] Callbacks should be used to ensure that feeds are loaded before they are tested
- [x] Error handling should be implemented for undefined variables and out-of-bound array access
- [x] When complete, all of your tests should pass
